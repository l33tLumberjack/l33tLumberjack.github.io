Hey there! Welcome to my site! Chances are you are here because either
<ol>
<li>We met in person and I gave you this link. Your awesome by the way :)</li>
<li>You got this link from a job application I submitted to your company</li>

## A little bit about me

I'm just an avid Infosec enthusiast that likes to write code that does things and I also have opinions about how security should be done and what needs to be done industry wide to improve.
